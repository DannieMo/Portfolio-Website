# Portfolio-Website

> This is the fourth milestone in the process of creating my portfolio website. In this milestone i:
- Enabled website responsiveness (on mobile and desktop) by adapting the use of media queries. 
- Embedded form spree into my project to be able to send messages.
- I added links to my nav bar. Clicking on each item or icon on the nav bar will lead to that section of the website. You should try iy out😍

PS. This is a practice project at Microverse: a remote software programming school. This project is my personal portfolio showing my work, skills, and history. You can seek me out if you are interested in the things i do or just chatting 😉.
