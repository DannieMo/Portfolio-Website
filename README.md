# Portfolio-Website

> This is the first milestone in the process of creating my portfolio website. In this milestone i:
- set up a new repository and prepared it for development using best practices (e.g. linters)
- build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using a template i chose from the list of templates given at Microverse (using FIGMA).

PS. This is a practice project at Microverse: a remote software programming school. This project is my personal portfolio showing my work, skills, and history. You can seek me out if you are interested in the things i do or just chatting üòâ.
