# Portfolio-Website

- This is the third milestone of my portfolio website. In this milestone i:
- Added contact form and footer 
- Embedded form spree into my project to be able to send messages.

PS. This is a practice project at Microverse: a remote software programming school. This project is my personal portfolio showing my work, skills, and history. You can seek me out if you are interested in the things i do or just chatting üòâ.
